# Agency Website Project
This project showcases a simple, responsive website for a fictional Creative Design Agency.

Overview
The project consists of an HTML file (index.html) and a CSS file (style.css). The HTML file includes sections for a logo, a headline, two service cards, and a footer. The CSS file provides styling for layout, typography, and responsiveness.

Features
Responsive Design: Utilizes flexbox and media queries for responsiveness across different screen sizes.
Typography: Uses the Google Font "Poppins" for a modern and clean look.
Service Cards: Demonstrates two service sections ("Beauty" and "Construction") with accompanying images and descriptions.
Footer: Includes a simple footer with a tagline.
Screenshots
Include screenshots or GIFs showcasing the website layout at different viewport sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
